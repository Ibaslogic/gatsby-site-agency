> **Please Note:** Look forward to the conversion of this Gatsby site to a reusable theme for your use. Keep in touch with me [@ibaslogic](https://twitter.com/ibaslogic) on Twitter for updates.

### Want to use or play with the code?

## 🚀 Quick start

You can download or clone the project by running this command from your terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Ibaslogic/gatsby-site-agency
```

This will create a directory in the name of the project folder.

Once you have the project files and folders bootstrapped, open it with your text editor.

Next, switch inside the project directory (e.g `cd gatsby-site-agency`) and run:

```
npm install
```

This will create a local `node_modules` folder and install all the necessary dependencies in it.

Finally, start your development server by running:

```
gatsby develop
```

You should see the gatsby site in your browser address bar at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
